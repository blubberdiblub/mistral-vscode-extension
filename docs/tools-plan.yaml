name: file_search
description: "Search for files in the workspace by glob pattern. This only returns
  the paths of matching files. Use this tool when you know the exact filename pattern
  of the files you're searching for. Glob patterns match from the root of the workspace
  folder. Examples:\n- **/*.{js,ts} to match all js/ts files in the workspace.\n-
  src/** to match all files under the top-level src folder.\n- **/foo/**/*.js to match
  all js files under any foo folder in the workspace."

name: grep_search
description: Do a fast text search in the workspace. Use this tool when you want
  to search with an exact string or regex. If you are not sure what words will 
  appear in the workspace, prefer using regex patterns with alternation (|) or 
  character classes to search for multiple potential words at once instead of 
  making separate searches. For example, use 'function|method|procedure' to look
  for all of those words at once. Use includePattern to search within files 
  matching a specific pattern, or in a specific file, using a relative path. Use
  this tool when you want to see an overview of a particular file, instead of 
  using read_file many times to look for code within a file.

        isRegexp property properly to declare whether it's a regex or plain text
        pattern. Is case-insensitive.

        the relative path of files within the workspace. To search recursively 
        inside a folder, use a proper glob pattern like "src/folder/**". Do not 
        use | in includePattern.

name: runSubagent
description: "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.
  This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing
  multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident
  that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform
  the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will
  wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single
  message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user.
  To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with
  a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will
  not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able
  to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should
  contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously
  and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to
  you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally
  be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just
  to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of
  the user's intent"
