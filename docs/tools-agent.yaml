  - After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting
  work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo
  (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable
  steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to
  use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational
  requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n\
  1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE
  todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific
  todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\
  \nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working

name: run_in_terminal
description: "This tool allows you to execute shell commands in a persistent zsh terminal
  session, preserving environment variables, working directory, and other context
  across multiple commands.\n\nCommand Execution:\n- Use && to chain simple commands
  on one line\n- Prefer pipelines | over temporary files for data flow\n- Never create
  a sub-shell (eg. bash -c \"command\") unless explicitly asked\n\nDirectory Management:\n\
  - Must use absolute paths to avoid navigation issues\n- Use $PWD for current directory
  references\n- Consider using pushd/popd for directory stack management\n- Supports
  directory shortcuts like ~ and -\n\nProgram Execution:\n- Supports Python, Node.js,
  and other executables\n- Install packages via package managers (brew, apt, etc.)\n\
  - Use which or command -v to verify command availability\n\nBackground Processes:\n\
  - For long-running tasks (e.g., servers), set isBackground=true\n- Returns a terminal
  ID for checking status and runtime later\n\nOutput Management:\n- Output is automatically
  truncated if longer than 60KB to prevent context overflow\n- Use head, tail, grep,
  awk to filter and limit output size\n- For pager commands, disable paging: git --no-pager
  or add | cat\n- Use wc -l to count lines before displaying large outputs\n\nBest
  Practices:\n- Quote variables: \"$var\" instead of $var to handle spaces\n- Use
  find with -exec or xargs for file operations\n- Be specific with commands to avoid
  excessive output\n- Use type to check command type (builtin, function, alias)\n\
  - Use jobs, fg, bg for job control\n- Use [[ ]] for conditional tests instead of
  [ ]\n- Prefer $() over backticks for command substitution\n- Use setopt errexit
  for strict error handling\n- Take advantage of zsh globbing features (**, extended
  globs)"

  not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able
  to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should
  contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously

  you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally

  and executing Python code snippets within a workspace environment. The 'Check Python
  file for syntax errors' tool allows users to identify syntax issues in Python files,
  providing detailed error messages that include line numbers and error types. This
  is particularly useful for debugging and validating code before execution. The 'Execute
  Python code snippets directly in the workspace environment' tool offers a seamless
  way to run Python code without the complications of terminal commands, ensuring
  that the correct Python interpreter is used and that output is formatted cleanly.
  Additionally, the 'Validate Python code snippets for syntax errors without saving
  to file' tool enables users to check for syntax errors in code snippets on-the-fly,
  making it ideal for quick validations and testing generated code. Together, these
  tools streamline the process of writing, testing, and debugging Python code, enhancing
  productivity and reducing errors in the development workflow.\n\nBe sure to call

  their project, including both resolved and unresolved imports. This is essential
  for understanding project dependencies and identifying any missing libraries. Complementing
  this, the 'Get available top-level modules from installed Python packages in environment'
  tool allows users to check which packages are installed and can be imported, aiding
  in verifying import availability. Together, these tools facilitate a comprehensive
